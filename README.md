Mongo, React, Express, Node, Tailwind

This is a React single page app I built for my barber. The idea was conceived in his barber's chair, while we were discussing our respective professions. He mentioned he wanted a place to show his porfolio of cuts and also showcase his merchandise. I've completed these two initial goals, gallery and merch, with React and Tailwind. In LA Lakers' colors.

Further, the React frontend is sitting on the barebones of an Express/Mongo backend that will provide user login/individual accounts for all his clients. This is also how I plan to implement the calendar functionality. Using react-calendar, I will write an algorithm which will attach a unique date/time ticket to a haircut appointment maker's MongoID in the database. This seems to me a fairly hardy way to do it, and I'll have a record of all appointments in the database in case anything goes wrong elsewhere.
